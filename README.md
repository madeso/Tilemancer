Tilemancer is a quick procedural tile creator designed for pixel-art games. Perfect for game jams, prototypes, texture mods, and more.

You can design tiles using a node-based approach in which a heightmap is created and later shaded by the program.

The program features a collection of noise generators, filters and presets, giving you freedom and speed when creating your own tiles.

All nodes and presets are programmed in [Lua](http://www.lua.org/), letting you create and modify effects.
